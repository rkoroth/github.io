Boot Process</h1>
<h2 id="linux-boot-process">Linux Boot Process</h2>
<p>Extensive knowledge of Linux boot process helps you to fix any boot
related issues. It doesn’t require any in-depth knowledge of the
underlying code, instead it requires only the knowledge about the
critical files. Linux booting is a multistage process from the boot
strap code to the shell until you get the login prompt. One can predict
and troubleshoot an un-bootable system if he has clear understanding
about the boot process.</p>
<p>Firmware This is the very first stage of booting any system. When a
system starts up, until the power good signal (gray cable in SMPS)
triggers, CPU receives a reset signal from chip-set. It releases the
reset once the power good signal activates and CPU starts executing the
code. How does the CPU know where to start addressing the memory.? This
is where EIP register comes into play. EIP register__Extended
Instruction Pointer__ is the register where CPU look for the address of
next instruction. When the system starts up, this register by default
resets with an address 0xFFFFFFF0 and this action is hard coded. This
location generally at the top of 4G address space and it is a ROM
location contains the address of BIOS. This location has only 16bytes in
size. This setup made in such a way back in the time of 8086 assuming
there will not be any conflict with the installed RAM (Assuming that
there cannot be any system with more than 4G RAM during 8086 era). Once
the CPU identifies the BIOS starting address, it start addressing BIOS
and executes the code in it. This stage is generally known as POST
(Power On Self Test).</p>
<p>During POST system verifies all the connected peripherals and loads
its firmwares and identifies its status. Once the POST completes, it
starts looking for the first boot device set in the CMOS. CMOS is a
non-volatile memory and its generally integrated with the clock chip or
inside the south bridge on modern systems. It requires a very low
current power source to retain its content generally a small lithium
battery (Known as CMOS battery).</p>
<p>Bootstrap Once the system identifies the first boot device, lets say
a hard disk, it address the MBR (Master Boot Record) which resides in
Cylinder 0, head 0 and sector 1. Generally a sector of hard disk is
512-bytes so as the first sector. The first 446 bytes of the first
sector contains the MBR and the next 64 bytes reserved for partition
table upto 4 partition. Without a partition table a hard disk is just a
piece of metal so this is important. The last 2 bytes for the magic
number - AA55. Magic number denotes the integrity of the MBR. A
different magic number would be considered as invalid MBR by the BIOS
and system would not boot. One thing should be noted here is MBR is not
located in any filesystem, its on the raw part of the hard disk so it
cannot be viewed from the file system. However a low level tool like
“dd” can be used to read MBR.</p>
<p>GRUB As you might already know, GRUB(GRand Unified Bootloader) is a
boot loader like LILO (Linux Loader). GRUB has three stages of
operation. Stage-1, 1.5 and 2. The above said MBR is the first stage of
GRUB and it passes the control to GRUB stage 1.5 which resides in the
MBR GAP.</p>
<p>MBR GAP : After sector 0, from 1 to 63 sectors are free and is known
as MBR GAP. This space is used for GRUB 1.5 which is ~32KB. (63*512).
You might be wondering why there are multiple stages of GRUB. Because
BIOS can read only the first 512 bytes of the boot device, and it is not
sufficient for including all the required boot drivers for the system
boot. GRUB 1.5 loads all the required modules and drivers specific to
GRUB stage 2 to access the /boot partition and reads
/boot/grub/grub.conf. This is where the system displays the boot
menu.</p>
<p>One important thing to be noted here is in the GRUB stage 2, it has
knowledge about the file system and able to read /boot from an ext2/ext3
file system instead of raw disk as in LILO. Also from GRUB 2 onward it
can read /boot even from LVM partition too.</p>
<p>GRUB version 0.9x known as GRUB legacy and version 1.9x known as
GRUB-2</p>
<p>GRUB 2 (precisely GRUB version 1.97) supports ext4 file system and
doesn’t have separate stages (eg: stage1/1.5)</p>

<p>dd command can be used for extracting MBR. In the above example
/dev/sda is the boot disk. od command converts the binary data to
hex.</p>
<p>Initramfs Once the system read the grub.conf file, it identifies the
location of initrd image from it. Initrd_Initial ramdisk_is a compressed
file which contains all the required modules for the kernel. Older
kernel uses initrd image file type which can be mounted as loop back
device, whereas the newer kernel comes with initrd image type as CPIO
archive. CPIO archive cannot be mounted instead it can be viewed using
lsinitrd command. See below.</p>

<p>Why initramfs..? actually kernel needs a lot of drivers and modules
for accessing different types of hardware, and building a kernel with
all the available drivers and modules make the kernel bulky and it
cannot be used for systems with less memory footprint. Initramfs acts as
a temporary bridge between actual kernel and the system. It builds based
on the system configuration and assists kernel to load by providing all
the required modules. for example, booting a system from SAN. It has
similar file system structure of a system such as /etc, /lib etc and
contains programs like insmod and rmmod to load and unload modules.</p>
<p>Kernel Once the required modules loaded, it passes the control to the
actual kernel which resides in /boot/. An example kernel file has shown
below.</p>
<pre><code>[root@t-centos-7 ~]# ls -ltr /boot/vmlinuz-*
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 6224704 Apr 20 12:57 /boot/vmlinuz-3.10.0-862.el7.x86_64
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 6224704 Sep 18 17:29 /boot/vmlinuz-0-rescue-8d15c6bacf504a4b805f50bcc96dc30b
[root@t-centos-7 ~]#</code></pre>
<p>Please note : Here vmlinuz-0-rescue-8d15c6bacf504a4b805f50bcc96dc30b
is a rescue kernel for troubleshooting a system during a boot
failure.</p>
<p>kernel file is a compressed bzImage and generally the size is less
than 10M.</p>
<pre><code>[root@t-centos-7 ~]# du -sh /boot/vmlinuz-3.10.0-862.el7.x86_64
6.0M    /boot/vmlinuz-3.10.0-862.el7.x86_64

[root@t-centos-7 ~]# file /boot/vmlinuz-3.10.0-862.el7.x86_64

[root@t-centos-7 ~]#</code></pre>
<p>Once the kernel verifies the processor family and architecture and
other required checks, it then initiate the first process PID 1
depending on the system version. i.e. on older system it is /sbin/init
and on RHEL-7 /usr/lib/systemd/systemd.</p>
